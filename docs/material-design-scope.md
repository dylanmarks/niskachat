# 📐 Material Design System Scope of Work

This document outlines the work required to apply a consistent Material Design system to NiskaChat. The goal is to enhance usability and ensure a cohesive look and feel across the application.

## 🎨 Design Foundation

- **Define design tokens** for colors, typography, spacing and elevation.
- **Select Angular Material** as the primary UI component library.
- **Create a custom theme** with SCSS variables for light and dark modes.
- **Establish global typography rules** (headings, body text, captions).

## 🏗️ Component Refactoring

- **Refactor existing components** to use Angular Material modules.
- **Develop reusable button components** with standardized styles and states.
- **Create card/surface components** for displaying grouped information.
- **Apply consistent spacing and responsive layout utilities**.
- **Add hover, focus and active states** for interactive elements.

## ♿ Accessibility & Testing

- **Review color contrast** and typography for WCAG AA compliance.
- **Implement keyboard navigation** and verify tab order across views.
- **Write tests** ensuring components follow design tokens and render properly on mobile.
- **Run existing test suites** to maintain overall coverage.

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

1. Run `ng add @angular/material` and configure the theme.
2. Introduce shared SCSS files for tokens and typography.
3. Update component templates to use Material directives and components.
4. Replace custom CSS with Material classes where possible.
5. Add additional Jest/Karma tests covering design tokens and interaction states.

Refer to **Phase 17** in `docs/tasks.md` for the checklist of tasks that drive these improvements.
