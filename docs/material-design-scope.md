# Material Design System Scope of Work

This document defines the scope for applying a consistent Material Design system to the NiskaChat application. The goal is to improve UI consistency, accessibility, responsiveness, and maintainability by leveraging Angular Material and custom design tokens. Use node.js standards for storing html and css properly.

## Design Foundation

- Define design tokens using SCSS for:

  - Color palette (primary, secondary, background, surface, error, etc.)
  - Typography (font family, weights, sizes for headings, body, captions)
  - Spacing (margin, padding scales)
  - Elevation (z-index and box-shadow layers)

- Select Angular Material as the primary UI component library

- Create a custom theme using Angular Material’s theming system:

  - Start with Material’s default light theme
  - Add dark theme support as needed
  - Store theme definitions in `theme.scss`

- Apply global typography rules consistently across the app

## Component Refactoring

- Refactor existing UI components to use Angular Material:

  - Buttons → `<button mat-button>` or `<button mat-raised-button>`
  - Cards → `<mat-card>`
  - Inputs/forms → `<mat-form-field>`, `<mat-input>`, `<mat-select>`, etc.
  - Navigation → `<mat-toolbar>`, `<mat-sidenav>`, `<mat-menu>`, etc.

- Replace custom CSS with shared design tokens or Angular Material utility classes

- Create reusable shared components:

  - `ButtonComponent` with standardized interaction states (hover, focus, disabled)
  - `CardComponent` or surface container for grouped content

- Apply consistent layout spacing and grid-based structure using CSS classes or Angular Material layout utilities

## Interaction and Visual States

- Add consistent hover, focus, and active styles using SCSS mixins or Angular Material states
- Use Material animations and transitions for modal dialogs and expandable sections
- Ensure visual feedback for user interactions is smooth and accessible

## Accessibility and Compliance

- Review color contrast to ensure WCAG AA compliance
- Ensure keyboard navigation and focus order is consistent and intuitive
- Use appropriate ARIA roles, `mat-label`, `mat-error`, and semantic HTML elements where needed

## Testing and Validation

- Write tests to validate:

  - All components follow the design token system
  - Visual states (hover, focus, disabled) are correctly applied
  - Typography and spacing are consistent across views
  - Components render properly across screen sizes
  - Color contrast meets accessibility standards
  - Tab and keyboard navigation works for all primary flows

- Run existing component and integration test suites to maintain coverage

## Implementation Steps

1. Install Angular Material using `ng add @angular/material`
2. Create shared SCSS files for theme tokens and typography
3. Configure the Angular Material theme in the project
4. Begin component-by-component refactoring using Material primitives
5. Replace inline styles with shared SCSS variables or utility classes
6. Write tests for shared components and interaction states
7. Validate accessibility, responsiveness, and design consistency
