**Overall Test Status**: 138 frontend + 40 backend = **178 tests passing** üéØ

## üìã **Priority Rationale**

**Phase 13 (Code Quality)** was moved from Phase 18 to immediate priority because:

- **Technical Debt Impact**: 20+ TypeScript `any` types and ESLint violations slow development
- **Foundation for Future Work**: Material Design (Phase 14) requires clean, type-safe code
- **Risk Mitigation**: Floating promises and unsafe operations introduce production bugs
- **Developer Experience**: Proper types and error handling improve maintainability

The sequence **Code Quality ‚Üí Material Design ‚Üí Chat Topics** creates a solid foundation for advanced features.
